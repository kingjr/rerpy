*****************************************************************************
*  This is an ascii version of the log file tiny-complete.log.  It is recommended*
*  that you modify only flags or condition codes; changing an event code    *
*  or time would cause mismatches between the edited log file and the raw   *
*  file when they are used by the averaging program.  Flags are represented *
*  by octal numbers.  Time is represented in sample clock ticks; to get     *
*  time in seconds, time value must be divided by the sampling rate.  Note  *
*  that the program asci2log reads only lines beginning with numbers.  This *
*  means that comments can be interspersed throughout the file as long as   *
*  the comment lines do not begin with a number.                            *

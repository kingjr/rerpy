have a special "cals" command that (1) arranges for the given events
to be included in a special bin in all output files, (2) eliminates
the given events from consideration for other stuff (maybe even just
deletes their code and condition entries)

or another way to do this, scoped restrictions?
select <query>
  # indented block
  # <query> is automatically ANDed with any queries within this
  # section

define "groups" as short-hands for certain queries? maybe better to
just add fields.

match code == 12 and condition == 0 as BASE
next with code == 13 within 200-800


wacky idea, just make the input file python code?
